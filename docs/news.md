### Guys, in this newsletter I will describe what has been done recently:

1. We have released version 12.1.19. This version fixes a bug on authentication with complex passwords. Removed Autologin function - it did not work correctly, make it work correctly, so it was cut out.  Also changed the logic of the application authorization. on some android phones, perhaps a way to authorize the phone gets a new ID. In that case you need to connect the subscription to the new device. If you use the API to create, then change the Device_id to the new one. We can delete the old device - just email us.
2. Now you can share your subscription with anyone. You can specify a Device ID when connecting a subscription to any other user's device. This can be useful if you are a dealer and work with your customers, providing them a sub-service.
3. Now a subscription which is not connected to a device does not fade by itself. That is, it starts counting when you link a subscription to a device. If you want to take a break, just disconnect from the device and that's it. When you need it, you can link it back up again. This feature works if you pay via PayPal or BTC. If you want to freeze a subscription purchased via Card (Visa/Mastercard), then write to us - for now this can only be done manually.
